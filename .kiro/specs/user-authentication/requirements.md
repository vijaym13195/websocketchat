# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete authentication system for the websocket chat application. The authentication system will provide secure user registration, login, session management, and authorization capabilities using industry-standard security practices. The system will integrate with the existing PostgreSQL database through Prisma ORM and support JWT-based authentication with refresh token functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account with email and password, so that I can access the chat application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with encrypted password
2. WHEN a user provides an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the email is already registered
3. WHEN a user provides invalid email format THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN a user provides a password shorter than 8 characters THEN the system SHALL return a password strength error
5. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL return authentication tokens (access and refresh)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to login with my credentials, so that I can authenticate and access protected features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides correct email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and return JWT tokens
2. WHEN a user provides incorrect credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error without revealing which field is incorrect
3. WHEN a user attempts login with non-existent email THEN the system SHALL return the same generic authentication error
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL update the user's last login timestamp
5. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL return both access token (15 minutes expiry) and refresh token (7 days expiry)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my session to be maintained securely, so that I don't have to re-login frequently while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's access token expires THEN the system SHALL accept a valid refresh token to issue new access tokens
2. WHEN a user provides an invalid or expired refresh token THEN the system SHALL require full re-authentication
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate both access and refresh tokens
4. WHEN a user's refresh token is used THEN the system SHALL rotate the refresh token for enhanced security
5. IF a refresh token is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide token revocation capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user passwords to be securely stored and managed, so that user data remains protected even if the database is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user password is stored THEN the system SHALL hash the password using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds
2. WHEN comparing passwords THEN the system SHALL use secure timing-safe comparison methods
3. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing refresh tokens
4. IF password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL generate secure reset tokens with expiration
5. WHEN storing authentication data THEN the system SHALL never store plaintext passwords or tokens

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want middleware for protecting routes, so that I can easily secure API endpoints and websocket connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN protecting HTTP routes THEN the system SHALL provide middleware that validates JWT tokens
2. WHEN a request has no token THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized status
3. WHEN a request has an invalid token THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized status
4. WHEN a request has a valid token THEN the system SHALL attach user information to the request object
5. WHEN protecting websocket connections THEN the system SHALL validate tokens during connection handshake

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my account information to be manageable, so that I can update my profile and maintain account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to change their password THEN the system SHALL require current password verification
2. WHEN a user updates their email THEN the system SHALL require email verification before activation
3. WHEN a user requests account deletion THEN the system SHALL provide secure account removal process
4. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL return non-sensitive user information
5. IF a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide secure password reset functionality
